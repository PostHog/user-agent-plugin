# User Agent Plugin

Enhances events to include the browser details when the event has a property `$useragent`
which allows off loading retrieving/parsing user agent strings at event ingest.

It's used to easily pass the `User-Agent` HTTP header from incoming requests and let
this plugin handle parsing it.
